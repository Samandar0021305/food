                    <p>Delivery of goods sent from different manufacturers. This method allows you to combine

                    Small batches of various goods are first brought to the cross-docking site, after which they
                    are reloaded into one transport and sent to the end customer. Cross-docking also allows you to get bulk from
                    manufacturer, and then send it in small quantities to various retail outlets.</p>
